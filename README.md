# Praapti
Praapti is the hindi term for "Yield" which represents not only a quantitative measurement of agricultural produce but also a variety of emotions in agricultural households. Ours is a country marked by exuberant Harvest Festivals and massive pride for our agriculture sector. The agriculture sector has been hit the worst by the Pandemic. In India out of 14.3 Crore Farmers, there is a 50-50 split between land owners and landless labours. After the lockdown is over, we expect a massive influx of labourers looking for jobs in the leading agricultural states. The infrastructure for such management simply does not exist and that is where we come in.  
  
We aim to provide a <em>Streamlined Infrastructure</em> to help workers avail job opportunities. Our solution also incorporates an <em>Inventory Management System</em>,where land owners can manage their land assets with ease. We provide a Role based authentication model for the ease of access of our users.

We have 2 roles in our portal:
1. The Land Owners sign in as <em><b>Owners</b></em>
2. The Workers sign in as <em><b>Employees</b></em>
